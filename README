1. Run the file setup.py. This would perform the following tasks:
	a. Install the necessary Python packages
	b. Copy the relevant data files into their appropriate locations

2. Test the code using Python version 3 by running the three Python scripts, say as follows:
	python3 line-overlaid-flux.py fluxes/01-MRVEL_fluxed1000.FIT
	python3 flux-inspect.py fluxes/01-MRVEL_fluxed1000.FIT
	python3 line-shift.py fluxes/01-MRVEL_fluxed1000.FIT
	
3. To use the defined methods, include this line in your own Python code:
	from astro_da.xmmrgs_lines import *

4. To inspect the code, access the following file:
	~/.local/lib/python3.X/site-packages/astro_da/xmmrgs_lines.py
	
	* here X would be replaced with the specific sub-version of Python on the local host, e.g. 3.5, 3.6 etc.

5. To modify the list of ions being taken into consideration by the code, access the following file:
	~/astro-data/ion.list
